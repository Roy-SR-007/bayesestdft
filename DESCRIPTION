Description: This package provides a Bayesian framework to estimate the Student's t-distribution's degrees of freedom. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling routines are developed as in <https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms11090462> to sample from the posterior distribution of the degrees of freedom. A random walk Metropolis (RMW) algorithm is used for sampling when Jeffreys and Gamma priors are endowed upon the degrees of freedom. In addition, the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm (MALA) for sampling is used under the Jeffreys prior specification. The Log-normal prior over the degrees of freedom is posed as a viable choice with comparable performance in simulations and real-data application, against other prior choices, where an Elliptical Slice Sampler (ESS) is used to sample from the concerned posterior.
